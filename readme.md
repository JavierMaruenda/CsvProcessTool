# CsvProcessTool

Tool to perform mathematical operations on .csv files with the data sorted in columns with the first row containing the column names.

The tool is created as a personal learning project to learn C++ and Python using open source solutions only.

The user interface is HTML based so a local server is required.
in the config section there are a couple of bash files to help the initial setup of an apache server.
